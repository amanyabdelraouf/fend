![Osteoprosis is a painful disease!](https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/08/26/10/55/ds00128_im02980_mcdc7_osteoporosis-_comparethu_jpg.jpg )

- In this project , I have covered a lot of information about osteoprosis.

- Osteoprosis is a really interesting subject in the medicine field.

- In this topic I Talked about many aspects of osteoprosis including:

           - Overview

           - Clinical presentation

           - Treatment and management

## Tech

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The landing pade is build by:

- linking the app.js. by index.html

- Building out the HTML file with 5 content sections.

- Building the navigation menu.

- Adding functionality to distinguish the section in view.

- Adding an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.

## Overview

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive disease of multifactorial etiology (see Etiology) and is the most common metabolic bone disease in the United States. It has been most frequently recognized in postmenopausal women, persons with small bone structure, the elderly, and in Caucasians and person of Asians background, although it does occur in both sexes, all races, and all age groups. Screening at-risk populations is essential and can identify persons with osteoporosis before fractures occur.
       
## clinical Presentation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Keep in mind that osteoporosis occurs in many people who have few or no risk factors for this condition. Often, patients who have not sustained a fracture do not report symptoms that would alert the clinician to suspect a diagnosis of osteoporosis; thus, this disease is a "silent thief" that generally does not become clinically apparent until a fracture occurs.


## Diagnostic Considerations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

 The differential diagnosis of osteoporosis is very extensive. When dealing with reduced bone density, always rule out the other possible causes before treating the patient for osteoporosis. Many patients have a coexisting cause of bone loss.
          

## Treatment & Management

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians on treatment to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis includes six recommendations: two strong recommendations, based on high- or moderate-quality evidence, and four weak ones, based on low-quality evidence. 
      


## Gidelines

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The 2020 update of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) guidelines recommends evaluation of all women age 50 or older for osteoporosis risk. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history, physical exam, and clinical fracture risk assessment with the Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) tool or other fracture risk assessment tool.
